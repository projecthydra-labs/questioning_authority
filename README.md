## Not seeing documentation you used to find in the README?

Much of the documentation has moved to the [Questioning Authority wiki](https://github.com/samvera/questioning_authority/wiki) to allow for better organization. We hope that you will find this easier to use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What does this do?

Provides a set of uniform RESTful routes to query any controlled vocabulary or set of authority terms. Results are returned in JSON and can be used within the context of a Rails application or any other Ruby environment. Primary examples would include providing auto-complete functionality via Javascript or populating a dropdown menu with a set of terms.

## How does it work?

Authorities are defined as classes, each implementing a set of methods allowing a controller to return results from a given vocabulary in the JSON format. The controller does three things:

- provide a list of all terms (if allowed by the class)
- return a set of terms matching a given query
- return the complete information for a specific term given its identifier

Depending on the kind of authority or its API, the controller may not do all of these things such as return a complete list of terms.

### Sub-Authorities

Some authorities, such as Library of Congress, allow sub-authorities which is an additional parameter that further defines the kind of authority to use with the context of a larger one.

## How do I use this?

Add the gem to your Gemfile

```
gem 'qa'
```

Run bundler

```
bundle install
```

Install the gem to your application

```
rails generate qa:install
```

This will copy over some additional config files and add the engine's routes to your `config/route.rb`.

Start questioning your authorities!

### Basic QA Requests

These show the basic routing patterns for connecting to authorities. See the [Questioning Authority wiki](https://github.com/samvera/questioning_authority/wiki) documentation for detailed documentation and examples for each authority and local authorities.

Return a complete list of terms:

```
/qa/terms/:vocab
/qa/terms/:vocab/:subauthority
```

Return a set of terms matching a given query

```
/qa/search/:vocab?q=search_term
/qa/search/:vocab/:subauthority?q=search_term
```

Return the complete information for a specific term given its identifier

```
/qa/show/:vocab/:id
/qa/show/:vocab/:subauthority/:id
```

### Typical JSON Results

Results are returned in JSON in this format:

```
[
    {"id" : "subject_id_1", "label" : "First labels"},
    {"id" : "subject_id_2", "label" : "Printing labels"},
    {"id" : "", "label" : "This term has no id number"},
    {"id" : "", "label" : "Neither does this"}
]
```

# Authority Sources information

See the [Questioning Authority wiki](https://github.com/samvera/questioning_authority/wiki) for documentation on how to connect to the supported authorities, documentation on how to create new authorities, and other useful tips.

# Developer Notes

[How to Contribute](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

To develop this gem, clone the repository, then run:

```
bundle install
rake ci
```

This will install the gems, create a dummy application under spec/internal and run the tests. After you've made changes, make sure you've included tests and run the test suite with a new sample application:

```
rake engine_cart:clean
rake ci
```

Commit your features into a new branch and submit a pull request.

## Compatibility

- Ruby 2.5 or the latest 2.4 version is recommended. Later versions may also work.
- Rails 5 is required. We recommend the latest Rails 5.2 release.

## Product Owner & Maintenance

Questioning Authority is a Core Component of the Samvera community. The documentation for what this means can be found [here](http://samvera.github.io/core_components.html#requirements-for-a-core-component).
